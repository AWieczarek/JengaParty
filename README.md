# JengaParty
Eventually, multiplayer mobile game for playing on the party. Something like "Drunk Jenga", but mobile. You have Jenga tower and when you pick a brick you get a challange 
to do. There are pre-defined challenges, but you can insert your own too. 

# ToDo
- Change multiplayer system to MLAPI
- Add challanges system
- Add lobby and GUI
